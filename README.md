# Project-3

Blog City

What it does:
Blog City allows travelers to share their past travel experience for the trips. They can share information such as time and locations, points of interest, comments, and photos of each place they have been to. So that other travelers can have a better idea about how each event will be.

How it works:
Users can share their travel experiences such as restaurants, points of interest and the comments and they will be stored in the database. Other travelers can search the trips based on the location and the duration.
